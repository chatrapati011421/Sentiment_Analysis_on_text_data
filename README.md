# Sentiment_Analysis_on_text_data

# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analyzer
This project is a simple machine learning-based sentiment analysis tool. It reads restaurant reviews and predicts whether they are positive or negative.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

# 1. Requirements

Make sure Python is installed on your system. Youâ€™ll also need to install a few Python libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
These libraries are used for data handling, natural language processing, machine learning, and visualizing the results.

# 2. Project Files
**This project includes:**

"The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, a widely trusted platform known for high-quality datasets and machine learning competitions."

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehabashraf/restaurant-reviewstsv/data), a trusted platform for high-quality datasets and machine learning projects.

The dataset must be placed in the same folder as the script before running it.

# 3. How the Project Works
  **The script performs the following tasks:**

  1.Loads the dataset containing restaurant reviews and labels

  2.Cleans and preprocesses the review text (removing punctuation, lowercasing, removing stopwords, and stemming)

  3.Converts the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization

  4.Splits the data into training and testing sets

  5.Trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the training data

  6.Evaluates the model using a classification report and confusion matrix

  7.Predicts the sentiment of new example reviews

# 4. Running the Script

To run the project, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the Python script. The script will train the model and output performance results along with predictions for sample reviews.

# 5. Example Output

When the script runs, it prints results like these:

**Review:** I loved the meal, everything was perfect!
**Prediction: Positive**

**Review:** Worst service and terrible food.
**Prediction: Negative**

**Review:** Tried for 1st time was very good and delicious.
**Prediction: Positive**

# 6. Output Visualization
**The script displays:**

  1.A classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score

  2.A confusion matrix plot using Seaborn for better visual understanding

# 7. Technologies Used
**This project uses the following tools and libraries:**

  1.Python

  2.Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

  3.NLTK for text preprocessing

  4.Scikit-learn for machine learning and evaluation

  5.Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

# Real-Life Applications
**This project allows restaurants and businesses to manually analyze customer reviews, providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction and helping improve services. It also facilitates sentiment monitoring, enabling users to evaluate feedback and respond to both positive and negative sentiments.**
